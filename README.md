# Coursera2
My (Kilted Viking's) solutions to assignments on Coursera course HTML, CSS and JavaScript for Web Developers.

I've also added my tests, entered while listening to lectures on course.

My solutions are in branch gh-pages, as this is the branch that was created to publish at https://kiltedviking.github.io/Coursera2. ;-)
